<p>This is the privacy policy for Privacy Policy for Swift HK Meetup App - hereafter referred to as TheApp.
TheApp is produced by New Perspectives Far East Limited registered at 3F, 148 Wing Lok Street, Sheung Wan Hong Kong - hereafter referred to as NPFE.</p>

<a id="app-users" class="anchor" href="#app-users" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>App users</h3>

<p>TheApp does collect and share information that you have chosen to make public to members of the Swift HK Meetup meetup.com group.  Your usage of TheApp constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>TheApp collects non-personally-identifying information such as the phone type, operating system version, language preference, and the date and time of each visitor request as well as crashlog information. TheApp's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how TheApp's visitors use TheApp and to offer features of general interest through aggregation of such information. TheApp may show non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, eg, by publishing trends in the usage in TheApp or on NPFE's website.  </p>

<p>TheApp does collect personally identifying information including name, photo, Facebook link, event participation, comments, replies, likes and other information that you have chosen to share via the meetup.com platform or by virtue of linking with your Facebook or Google account. This is displayed and made available in a largely similar fashion to that of the Meetup.com App and/or the meetup.com website.  Additionally users of TheApp may download and make their own, personal, permanent archive of the information in TheApp.  </p>

<h3>
<a id="business-transfers" class="anchor" href="#business-transfers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Business Transfers</h3>

<p>If NPFE, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that NPFE goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, TheApp's user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of TheApp or NPFE may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<h3>
<a id="privacy-policy-changes" class="anchor" href="#privacy-policy-changes" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

<p>NPFE may change this Privacy Policy from time to time at NPFE's sole discretion. NPFE encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of TheApp after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>

<h3>
<a id="limited-warranties" class="anchor" href="#limited-warranties" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Limited Warranties</h3>

<p>NPFE does not warrant the completeness or accuracy of the information published in TheApp; nor do we commit to ensuring that TheApp remains available or that the material on the TheApp is kept up to date. </p>

<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we exclude all representations, warranties and conditions relating to TheApp and its use (including, without limitation, any warranties implied by law in respect of satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose and/or the use of reasonable care and skill).</p>

<h3>
